              <p>
                This project didn't start in a boardroom. It started in a late-night conversation between college friends in Rajasthan, watching brilliant, creative people get pushed into the same few "safe" career paths. We saw the immense pressure, the lack of real guidance, and the frustration of being stuck in a race you never wanted to run. We knew there had to be a better way.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem, we realized, wasn't a lack of opportunities in India; it was a crisis of <strong>awareness, confidence, and experience</strong>.

              <p>
                Our mission is to end career confusion. We are here to build a platform that empowers every student to discover their own path, on their own terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe a story is more powerful than a statistic. We believe your past education is a toolkit, not a trap. And we believe the best way to find your future is to get real, hands-on experience today.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's why our platform is built on three core principles:

                <li><strong>Discover:</strong> Explore authentic stories from a diverse range of real-world professionals.</li>
                <li><strong>Connect:</strong> Use our unique AI to build a bridge between the skills you already have and the careers you're curious about.</li>
                <li><strong>Experience:</strong> Take action with real, paid "micro-internships" and projects that build your portfolio and your confidence.</li>
